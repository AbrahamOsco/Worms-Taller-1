## 0.7.1 - 2015-03-27
### Fixed
* Miscellaneous style, documentation and build system fixes

## 0.7.0 - 2015-01-22
### Added
* More `Texture`, `Renderer` (both complete now) and `Window` methods
* New methods: `Point::Clamp()`, `Point::Wrap()`, `Rect::Extend()`, `Rect::IntersectLine()`
* STL stream output for `Point` and `Rect` (as in `std::cout << Rect(10, 20, 30 40);`)

### Changed
* Most setters now return reference to self to allow method chaining
* Exception now stores both SDL error and name of function which caused it; `what()` message now includes these both in a readable way, so SDL2pp exceptions may be conveniently handled with `catch (std::exception&)`
* pkg-config file now provides SDL libraries along with SDL2pp, so users don't need to care of SDL2 flags in addition to SDL2pp's

### Removed
* Deprecated `Point` and `Rect` methods: `Null()`, `IsNull()`, `Get()`

### Fixed
* Use move, not copy in constructing `RWops` from `CustomRWops`-derived class

## 0.6.0 - 2015-01-11
### Added
* [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org/) documentation for the whole library
* Wrapper around [SDL_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) initialization/deinitialization: `SDLImage` class
* `Surface``, a wrapepr for [SDL_Surface](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Surface) including [SDL_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) support. It's now also possible to construct `Texture` from `Surface`.
* Bunch of constructors from existing SDL objects (e.g. `Window::Window(SDL_Window*)`) for `Point`, `Rect`, `Window`, `Renderer`, `Texture`
* Complete [SDL_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) support
* Consistent `GetWidth()`/`GetHeight()`/`GetSize()` for `Texture` and `Surface`
* More operators, constructors and methods for `Point` and `Rect`

### Fixed
* Added proper error checking for SDL_image-using Texture constructors
* Multiple fixes in build system

## 0.5.2 - 2014-12-30
### Fixed
* Added missing include file to installation

## 0.5.1 - 2014-12-27
### Fixed
* Potential problems with SDL2 error handling

## 0.5.0 - 2014-12-26
### Added
* `AudioDevice::LockHandle` is now copyable
* `Rect` now has `+` `-` `+=` `-=` operators to offset it by a `Point`
* `Optional` class to pass optional values
* Possibility to use c++1y standard and detection of available useful c++1y features with c++11
* Default argument for `Texture::Lock()`
* Bunch of `Window` functions: `Window::Maximize()`, `Window::Minimize()`, `Window::Hide()`, `Window::Restore()`, `Window::Raise()`, `Window::Show()`, `Window::SetFullscreen()`, `Window::SetSize()`
* More granular build options for tests and examples

### Changed
* `Point` and `Rect` no longer have invalid (null) states and are now directly derived from [SDL_Point](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Point) and [SDL_Rect](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Rect) structures. In places where null states were usable (e.g. usually null `Rect` would mean "whole area", like in `Texture::Lock()`), `Optional` class is now used. Use `NullOpt` instead of `Point::Null()` and `Rect::Null()`

## 0.4.0 - 2014-12-19
### Added
* `StreamRWops` which works with STL streams
* `AudioDevice` and `Texture` `LockHandle`s now have empty constructors and may be initialized after construction
* `RWops` `(Read|Write)(LE|BE)(16|32|64)` methods
* pkg-config file

### Changed
* Plain `ContainerRWops` is now able to work with both const and mutable containers
* Audio callback is now tied to `AudioDevice`, not `AudioSpec`, which is cleaner and easier to use

### Removed
* `ConstContainerRWops` which is no longer needed

### Fixed
* Exception safety when changing audio callback
* Made `-Werror` flag conditional for user convenience

## 0.3.0 - 2014-11-30
### Added
* [SDL audio](https://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryAudio) functionality

### Fixed
* Proper self-assignment handling in move assignment operators

## 0.2.0 - 2014-11-25
### Added
* Getters for `Texture` properties: `Texture::GetWidth()`, `Texture::GetHeight()`, `Texture::GetFormat()`, `Texture::GetAccess()`
* `Texture` locking
* New `Rect` method `Rect::Contains()` to check if it contains a `Point`

## 0.1.1 - 2014-09-09
### Added
* Installation
* Library version

## 0.1.0 - 2014-09-05
### Added

* New `SDL` methods: `SDL::WasInit()`, `SDL::InitSubsystem()`, `SDL::QuitSubSystem()`
* Basic MSVC support
* Arithmetic operators for `Point`

### Fixed
* GUI tests which are sensible to OpenGL implementation-specific behavior are no longer fatal

### Added
* Unit tests
* New `Window` methods: `Window::GetSize()`, `Window::GetWidth()`, `Window::GetHeight()`, `Window::SetTitle()`
* New `Renderer` method: `Renderer::ReadPixels()`
* `Point` and `Rect` setters and comparison operators

## 0.0.1 - 2014-02-01
### Added
* Initial release supporting basic `Window`, `Renderer`, `Texture`, `Rect` and `Point` handling
